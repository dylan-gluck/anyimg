# Feature Specification: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Generation CLI

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-building`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We are building a simple CLI tool to generate images using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model. User may specify up to 3 input images and a prompt. The default save location is the current directory, file named anyimg_$timestamp.png. If out path provided, image will be saved to that path. The batch flag will re-run the same request as many times as specified, if out path provided append an index to the filename. Example usage in README.md"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: When the output file already exists, what should the tool do? ‚Üí A: Auto-rename with suffix (e.g., `image_1.png`, `image_2.png`)
- Q: In batch mode, if some image generation requests fail partway through, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Save all successfully generated images, continue despite failures
- Q: When the output directory doesn't exist, what should the tool do? ‚Üí A: Automatically create all necessary parent directories
- Q: What image formats should be accepted for input images? ‚Üí A: PNG and JPEG/JPG only
- Q: Should there be a timeout for API requests to Gemini 2.5 Flash? ‚Üí A: 60 seconds timeout

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to generate one or more images by providing a text prompt and optionally up to 3 reference images. The tool sends the request to Gemini 2.5 Flash and saves the generated image(s) to the specified location or a default timestamped filename in the current directory.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user provides only a text prompt, **When** they run the CLI tool, **Then** an image is generated and saved as `anyimg_<timestamp>.png` in the current directory
2. **Given** the user provides a prompt and 1-3 input images, **When** they run the CLI tool, **Then** an image is generated using the prompt and input images as context
3. **Given** the user specifies a custom output path, **When** they run the CLI tool, **Then** the image is saved to that exact path
4. **Given** the user specifies a batch count of N and a custom output path, **When** they run the CLI tool, **Then** N images are generated and saved with indexed filenames (e.g., `output_1.png`, `output_2.png`, etc.)
5. **Given** the user specifies a batch count of N without a custom output path, **When** they run the CLI tool, **Then** N images are generated with timestamped filenames

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user specifies more than 3 input images?
- What happens when input image files don't exist or can't be read?
- System auto-creates output directories if they don't exist
- What happens when the API request fails or times out?
- What happens when batch count is 0 or negative?
- System auto-renames with numeric suffix when output file exists
- What happens if API rate limits are hit during batch generation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a text prompt as a required input parameter
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept 0 to 3 input images as optional parameters
- **FR-003**: System MUST reject requests with more than 3 input images
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that all specified input image files exist and are readable before making the API request
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate images using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- **FR-006**: System MUST save generated images to the current directory as `anyimg_<timestamp>.png` by default
- **FR-007**: System MUST accept an optional output path parameter to specify custom save location
- **FR-008**: System MUST save to the exact path specified when an output path is provided
- **FR-009**: System MUST accept an optional batch parameter to generate multiple images with the same prompt
- **FR-010**: System MUST append an index to the filename when batch mode is used with a custom output path (e.g., `custom_1.png`, `custom_2.png`)
- **FR-011**: System MUST create separate uniquely timestamped files when batch mode is used without a custom output path (e.g., anyimg_20250930_143052.png, anyimg_20250930_143053.png)
- **FR-012**: System MUST display clear error messages for all error conditions including: missing/unreadable input files, invalid image formats, validation errors (>3 images, batch count < 1, empty prompt), API errors (authentication, timeout, rate limiting, invalid response), and network failures. Each error message MUST include remediation guidance.
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide example usage documentation in README.md
- **FR-014**: System MUST automatically create all necessary parent directories when the output path directory does not exist
- **FR-015**: System MUST auto-rename output files with numeric suffix when the target path already exists (e.g., `image_1.png`, `image_2.png`)
- **FR-016**: System MUST accept PNG and JPEG/JPG formats for input images and reject other formats with a clear error message
- **FR-017**: System MUST timeout API requests to Gemini 2.5 Flash after 60 seconds and display a clear error message
- **FR-018**: System MUST NOT introduce artificial delays between batch requests. API rate limit errors from Gemini shall be handled as individual request failures per FR-019, allowing the batch to continue processing remaining items.
- **FR-019**: System MUST save all successfully generated images in batch mode and continue processing despite individual request failures
- **FR-020**: System MUST report which batch items succeeded and which failed at completion

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Input Image**: A reference image file provided by the user, used as context for image generation. Maximum of 3 per request. Must be readable file in PNG or JPEG/JPG format.
- **Text Prompt**: A textual description provided by the user to guide image generation. Required for every request.
- **Generated Image**: The output PNG image created by Gemini 2.5 Flash. Saved with either default timestamp naming or custom path.
- **Batch Request**: A series of N identical generation requests executed sequentially, each producing a separate output image.
